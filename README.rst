pdf2zip
-------

pdf2zip is a small utility to batch convert PDFs that are image based (like
many online distributions of magazines are) into a zipfile full of images.
Various options are available, including options on the quality of the
resulting images, options to scale or resize the images to a bounding box,
and the ability to specify pages in the PDF to skip.

This was primarily developed for personal use, but is made available in the
hopes that it might be useful for someone.  This project is relatively
complete and will only be updated for compatability (new OSes or versions
of its dependencies) or device support (new tablets).

To install, just::

    pip install pdf2zip
